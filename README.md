ATMFrame: This class contains the user interface of the system.
Controller: This class handles the communication between the model and the view.
Model: This class contains the data and the logic of the system.
DAO: This class handles the database operations.
Testing:
The Bank Management System (ATM) is tested using unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing is performed on individual components of the system, while integration testing is performed on the system as a whole.
